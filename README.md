# Coding Workouts

## About

Just as I like to be in perfect physical shape to be able to function at my highest potential, I want to keep my coding skills sharp and improve on existing skills or create new ones.

## AOC 2023 Python

My first goal is to bring my Python knowledge at Wizard leve and I will start by implementing the Advent of Code 2023. Documentation for that can be found [here](https://github.com/andreivisan/workout/tree/master/aoc_2023_py)
